# Manga Naming Scheme

#### **Name of Manga [lang] - ch000-000 (v00) [Extra Information] [Group]{revision}.zip**

- **Name of Manga** is ***required***. A full title ***must*** always be used. New releases ***must*** use the same title as older releases. For first releases with no older releases to go by, here is how the title should be decided:
  - Japanese should be romanized with [Hepburn romanization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization). Long vowels (ō, ū, etc) are to be written without macrons (ou, uu, etc).
  - Non-Japanese katakana words should be romanized to the matching language (eg. レールガン should become "Railgun").
  - If a kanji is given a foreign katakana reading, the previous also applies (eg. 超電磁砲 read as レールガン should be "Railgun", ***not*** "Choudenjihou")
  - Title Case ***should*** be used for capitalization.
- **[lang]** is a [three-letter ISO-639-2 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) ***required*** for Non-English releases. English releases are ***required*** to omit this.
- **ch000** chapter number is ***required***. If multiple chapters are included (eg. if you are doing a full volume release), the range ***must*** be indicated with the **-000**. Chapter numbers ***must*** be padded to three digits minimum.
- If a chapter has no clear number associated with it, the logically or chronologically previous chapter number should be chosen and incremented by 0.1 - **[Extra Information]** is ***recommended*** in these cases to specify the type of the chapter.
- **(v00)** volume numbering is ***required*** for tankobon scans, and ***unallowed*** for magazine scans. This allows one to easily distinguish magazine and tankobon releases, and volume information usually is not available at the time of a magazine release anyway. Volume numbers ***must*** be padded to two digits minimum.
- **[Extra Information]** is ***optional***.
- **[Group]** is ***required***. If group is not known, **[Unknown]** ***must*** be used.
- **{revision}** is ***optional***. Recommended formatting is either **{r0}** or **{v0}**.
- **.zip** A file extension is ***required***. Zip is the ***recommended*** archive format due to its universality.

### Exceptions for Oneshots
- Oneshots ***must*** omit all numbering - **ch000-000 (v00)**.
- Oneshots ***must*** include **[Extra Information]**, which ***must*** include *Oneshot* at minimum.
