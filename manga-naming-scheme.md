# Manga Naming Scheme

#### **Name of Manga [lang] - c000-000 x0 (mag/v00-00) [Extra Information] [Group]{revision}.zip**

- **Name of Manga** is ***required***. A full title ***must*** always be used. New releases ***must*** use the same title as older releases. For first releases with no older releases to go by, here is how the title should be decided:
  - Japanese should be romanized with [Hepburn romanization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization). Long vowels (ō, ū, etc) are to be written without macrons (ou, uu, etc).
  - Non-Japanese katakana words should be romanized to the matching language (eg. レールガン should become "Railgun").
  - If a kanji is given a foreign katakana reading, the previous also applies (eg. 超電磁砲 read as レールガン should be "Railgun", ***not*** "Choudenjihou")
  - If the series has a canonical English / Western name *from the original author(s)* to go with its Japanese kanji title, it should be used instead of romanizing the Japanese kanji. Examples:
      -  シドニアの騎士 should use "Knights of Sidonia", ***not*** "Sidonia no Kishi"
      - 蒼き鋼のアルペジオ should use "Arpeggio of Blue Steel", ***not*** "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio"
      - 鋼の錬金術師 should use "Fullmetal Alchemist", ***not*** "Hagane no Renkinjutsushi"
      - 進撃の巨人 should use "Attack on Titan", ***not*** "Shingeki no Kyojin"
  - Title Case ***should*** be used for capitalization.
- **[lang]** is a [three-letter ISO-639-2 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) ***required*** for Non-English releases. English releases are ***required*** to omit this.
- **c000** chapter number is ***required***. If multiple chapters are included (eg. if you are doing a full volume release), the range ***must*** be indicated with the **-000**. Chapter numbers ***must*** be padded to three digits minimum.
  - If a series start with no clear chapter numbering of its own, the **c** ***must*** be dropped so that only numbers remain.
  - Oneshots should be numbered as **000**, with no **c** in front. **[Extra Information]** stating that it is a oneshot **should** be included.
  - If the series starts using clear chapter numbers at some point afterwards, then the **c** ***must*** be reintroduced.
  - If chapter numbers go into four digits, the **c** ***must*** be changed into **d** to ensure correct sorting.
  - With chapter ranges, the second number ***must*** not have any unit associated with it, unless a numbering system transition happens.

- **x0** is intended to be used with chapters that deviate from a clear numbering system (eg. decimal chapter numbers like 10.5) already in place and ***must*** be used for these, and ***must*** be left out for regular chapters. **[Extra Information]** is ***recommended*** in these cases to specify the type of the chapter. If sequential special chapters go beyond one digit, **x** is to be changed to **y**. In the rare case of specials going to three digits in the same sequence, **z** is to be used. Examples:

- **(mag)** or **(v00)** is ***required*** - all magazine scans **must** use the former, and all tankoubon scans **must** use the latter, with the appropriate volume number. Volume numbers are **unallowed** for magazine scans. If multiple volumes are included in a single archive, the range ***must*** be indicated with the **-00**. However, this is ***not recommended***. The range is **required** not to include an unit unless a range transition happens, ie. **v99-w100**. Volume numbers ***must*** be padded to two digits minimum. If no volume number is present, **(v00)** ***must*** be used. If volume numbers go beyond two digits, **v** is to be changed to **w** to ensure proper sorting.
- **[Extra Information]** is ***optional***.
- **[Group]** is ***required***. If group is not known, **[Unknown]** ***must*** be used.
- **{revision}** is ***optional***. Recommended formatting is either **{r0}** or **{v0}**.
- **.zip** A file extension is ***required***. Zip is the ***recommended*** archive format due to its universality.
